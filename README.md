# Law and Governance of AI

## Project Description
This project is for the class "Law and Governance of Artificial Intelligence" at [Northwestern University](www.northwestern.edu).

### Problem
The U.S. Stock market is the largest financial market in the world and there is an increasing need to protect it from malicious activities, such as inside trading. As the business activities become ever more complicated today, from the public sector to the private one, from the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/) to the group led a compliance officer in a company, fast and reliable monitoring tools are in ever high demand.

### Goal
Our goal is to efficiently detect suspicious activities in financial markets, in particular the U.S. stock market.

### Result
We built several methods to detect abnormal transction patterns, including the 8 patterns proposed in the paper below. The data we used are from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/). As for the future work, we plan to incorporate other features such as organizationâ€™s ranking on the news/[Twitter](www.twitter.com) etc. This would help us to corroborate any red flags we raise using our unsupervised techniques.
